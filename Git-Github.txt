I have all the commands that we use in git in this file.

----------------------------------------*--------------------------------

Connect github to local host: 
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "email id"

change file name 
git mv file from file to

Changing directory:
change from one folder to another - cd foldername
exit the folder - cd ..

Downloading git repository to vs code 
git clone repolink

create a file in local repo and updating in remote repo
git add filename 
git status
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

How changes in the file is been moved from local repo to remote repo:
vs code - changes made in vs code - WORKING FOLDER 
|
git copy folder 
|
github

deleting a file in local repo and updating in remote repo
git add filename ("add" doesn't mean adding a file, it mean any changes in the repository)
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main 

Creating a file in remote repo and updating in local repo
git pull

modify the file in remote repo and to update in local repo 
git pull 

Create a new folder in local repo and to make it as a git folder 
init git

Create multiple files inside the folder and instead of selecting each file and pushing it to the origin
git add .
git commit -m "message"

while pushing we might face error since it ais a new folder we need to connect to the origin, so create a new repository and connect using the origin link
git remote add originlink
git BRANCHESgit push origin master (or)
git branch -M main
git push origin main

Creating new folder in local repo and pushing it to the remote repo
git add . 
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

BRANCHES
-------------------*----------------------

to list down the branches in repo
git branch -a

after creating a branch in remote it will not reflect in local repo so we need to pull the changes
git pull 

to switch from one branch to another
git checkout branchname

switch from main branch to sub branch
- create a file in branch
- add the file to staging area
- commit the file
- push to branch 
git checkout branchname
git branch -a
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin branchname 

Why we need sub branches?
- Main branch has important and finalized code
- The su branches are created to code, test, and validate without disturbing the main branch
- After developing it is merged to main branch

Merging sub branch to main branch
- After pushinh file to sub branch, when there is no changes
- Switch from sub branch to main branch 
- Check branch status 
- Merge the sub branch to main 
- Still it will nto reflect, push the main branch 
git checkout main 
git branch -a
git merge subbranch name
git push origin main 

PULL REQUEST
- create a sub branch in terminal and push it to remote repo

Pull request is a notification to merge sub branch to main branch after testing and validation, when you don't have access to main branch.
We cannot create pull request in terminal or local repo.

In remote repo,
- switch to main branch 
- above the tabs click pull requests
- select the branch to merge and write down notes
- create a pull request
- go to pull request
- open the new pull request 
- after verifying merge the pull request
- the branch is merged to main branch.
